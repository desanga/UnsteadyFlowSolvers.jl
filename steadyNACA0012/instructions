A simplified testing function for thick IBL solver...

1) run the simRun.jl script once (this will return qu, ql to the workspace)
2) Execute include("testFunction.jl") command to run the script
3) Then call the function, del, E = startSim(qu, 140, 300, true), where 140 and
    300 are number of cells and time-steps respectively
4) Set the boolean switch to false to turn-off the interactive mode (no graphs)


The coupled solver for thick cases

1) Execute include("simRun1.jl"). (Currently there is no option to turn-off the interactive mode)
